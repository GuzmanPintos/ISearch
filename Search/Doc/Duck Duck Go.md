### An overview of DuckDuckGo [!bangs ](https://api.duckduckgo.com/bang)
*(Probably the coolest feature out there)*

Duck Go bangs are a way of searching directly from other sites search engines and there 
A lot search engines out there. 

Eg to search amazon directly we just go

<code>!a shoes</code>

And voila the results are opened up in the default Amazon web page you think that isn't :cool: 

Then it is :fire: 

```
DuckDuckGo EXPLICITLY states that bangs actually happen outside its domain
In other websites and hence as the end user, your searches are directly governed  by that websites
policy. Including data collection
```
